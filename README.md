# ExVectr Windows Platform Implementation
Part of the ExVeCtr project. 
This library implements the core functionality to get a ExVeCtr project running on a Windows machine. 
As the initial ExVeCtr development is being done on windows, this library has not been tested on linux, but should work as no windows specific stuff is used.
## **This project is under initial development. Things will probably break.**
## Current goal roadmap:
- [X] Implement internal precise clock.
